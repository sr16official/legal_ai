Project to empower people 

## Overview

This project aims to empower citizens of India by making them aware of their legal rights and the Indian legal system. In India, a significant number of court cases are pending, and individuals often face numerous challenges when navigating the legal landscape. This project addresses this issue by providing users with information and tools to understand their rights and the legal processes involved.

## Key Features

* **Legal Query Answering:** Users can ask questions related to Indian law, and the system will provide relevant information based on the vast legal datasets it has been trained on.
* **Bail Prediction:** The system can assess the chances of bail being granted for a specific case based on historical data and legal precedents. This feature helps users understand their likelihood of success when applying for bail.
* **Language Support:** The project offers support for both English and Hindi, the two most widely spoken languages in India. This makes the information accessible to a larger population.

## Models

The project utilizes two state-of-the-art language models fine-tuned on specific legal datasets:

* **English Model:** Fine-tuned on the Llama 12B parameter model.
* **Hindi Model:** Fine-tuned on the Nanda B 10B parameter model.

## Dataset

The legal datasets used to train the models consist of a comprehensive collection of Indian Supreme Court and High Court judgments. This ensures that the system is well-versed in Indian law and can provide accurate information.

## Usage

To use the system, users can interact with it through a simple interface. They can type their legal queries or provide case details to receive relevant information and predictions. The system is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate.

## Future Work

## Future Work

* **Expanding Language Support:** Adding support for more regional languages of India to cater to a wider audience.
* **Integrating with Legal Resources:** Linking the system to online legal resources and databases to provide users with more comprehensive information.
* **Developing a Mobile App:** Creating a mobile application for easier access and portability.
* **Leveraging Advanced Hardware:** Exploring the use of more advanced GPUs to improve model training and performance.
